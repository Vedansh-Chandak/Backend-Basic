üöÄ My Backend Development Journey
Welcome to my backend development journey! I'm excited to dive into the world of server-side programming, databases, and APIs. This repository will serve as a collection of projects, learning resources, and experiments as I build my skills and explore backend technologies.

üåø Why Backend Development?
Backend development powers the logic behind web applications, managing data, authentication, and server operations. Learning backend development will allow me to create robust, scalable, and efficient applications that bring ideas to life.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack I‚Äôm Exploring
Here are some technologies and tools I‚Äôll be working with:

Programming Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
Framework: Express.js
Database: MongoDB, MySQL
API Development: RESTful and GraphQL
Authentication: JWT, OAuth
Deployment: Vercel, Render
Version Control: Git & GitHub

Learning Goals
Build RESTful APIs from scratch
Implement CRUD operations with databases
Develop user authentication and authorization systems
Create scalable and secure backend applications
Collaborate using best coding practices and clean code principles

Projects in Progress
Basic CRUD API
User Authentication System
Blog Management App
Budget-Friendly Trip Planner Backend

Let's Connect!
I'm always eager to learn, share knowledge, and collaborate. If you're also on a backend journey or have any insights, feel free to reach out!

Stay tuned for updates as I progress on this exciting path. Let‚Äôs build something amazing together!
